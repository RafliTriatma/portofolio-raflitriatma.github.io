                <h2><b>Briefing</b></h2>
                <div>As a UI/UX Designer, my role in the Yuan Garden project was to design the 
                    application mockup based on the guidance provided by the Product Owner and 
                    Project Manager at Yuan Garden. The brief was usually delivered through Google 
                    Meet and Zoom meetings.

                <h2><b>How to Get Insight</b></h2>
                <div>There were several methods I used to gain insights. One of them was by 
                    collaborating with the business analyst team to gather business-related 
                    insights, and conducting comparative analysis to identify which features 
                    needed to be designed and which ones could be excluded.

                <h2><b>Define</b></h2>
                <div>Based on the insights gathered, my team and I organized the information 
                    using the card sorting technique in FigJam, which helped us easily determine 
                    which features needed to be designed.
